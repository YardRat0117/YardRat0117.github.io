So, I guess that's all you need to know about me: currently a CS-major undergrad student.

I worked on several research projects, in LLM security and privacy over the last year, which turned out to be quite stressful. 

And hence, I quit more or less, in practical, since **nobody literally cares about me, my psychological health, and my work** (this used to be quite upsetting, but now it's really nice).

However, I'd say that it's yet still bittersweet rather than pure torturous. Perhaps I'm gonna work on some posts about my research's premature death.

And for now, I'm thinking about running a job after undergrad graduation - yes, NO GRAD SCHOOL. This is to some extent due to **my loss on my research**, and to some other extent due to **my can't getting a grad offer**.

But it's not actually that desperate, since "majoring in CS" doesn't necessary mean bundles and pressure - it could also be of some advantages, especially when you got involved into **trying to get hired as an undergrad**. 

And as a bonus fun fact, I've also been using Debian as my working OS over the last year, which means I got interested in working with GNU Unix-alike OS, and feels **at least not bad** to work around with it.

Note that, I just don't wanna mention that name, Mr. You-Know-Who really sucks on his taste about CXX, and even worse, **his idiot nationalism ideology** and his abusing for privileges over the kernel code.

Thus, I've been thinking about running a job as Cloud Native / DevOps engineer after graduation (**if I can**), and perhaps I'm gonna go deeper with these OS, containerization, automation and Golang stuff later.

In addition, there's some other bulletins that you might be interested of, such as:

- I'm a furry fandom, ever since my 15s. Quite typical for such a nerd like me to adore.

- I'm using vim and debian sid to build this site, with my favorite KDE Plasma and Hyprland stuff. They are really fantastic stuff to work with for PC.

- I produce some rubbish posts here from now and then. Hope that's not why you are here.

Whatever you've read, I still hope that my page could be helpful - at least so as I hope. You can contact me via the email below :)
